      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been recommended a book by a friend, but once you start reading it, you notice that 
          it has things that go against your standards? With my website, you will be able to look at ratings, 
          warnings, and purchase edited books so this will never happen again. With my website, customers 
          will not only be able to keep a personal record of the books they have read, but they will also be 
          able to leave reviews about warnings about content for fellow consumers! Additionally, there will 
          be generated warnings like age ratings, sex-related content, and language usage from the internet 
          all in one location! My goal is to make sure readers of all ages can enjoy books to the fullest
           without the worry of uncomfortable content, by buying edited books or by looking at the recommendations.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience would be 12 and up, male and female. 
          The content of books, or misleading books, have become a large problem for 
          people of all ages. Whether it is because someone is trying to find a book for their
           own personal use or trying to inspect a book for a friend or a loved one. The lack 
           of websites that can provide accurate warnings for books is astonishing. However,
            with ‘Book-Worm’, people will be able to find a large variety of reviews and ratings 
            in one website</p>  <!-- change this -->
